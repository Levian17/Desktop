This is the final project that I made for the cross-platform development course.

It consists of a cross-platform application (able to be deployed on web, desktop, and mobile) that replicates the classic chess game and allows you to play against the Stockfish AI.

    Source code:

    The source code is divided into three parts:
        Script for creating the structure of the database I worked with.
        Python project containing the API and the Stockfish engine.
        Flutter project containing the frontend of the application.
